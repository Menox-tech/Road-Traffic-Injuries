# Road Traffic Injuries Classifier
# Abstract 
This repository is dedicated to predicit road traffic injuries. The used data is collected from Kaggle of about 131956 entries splitted in different files, and over than 25 features. The overall goal here is to predict 'injury severity', which is a multi-class classification issue, based on analysing the provided dataset. According to data specification, injured people are classified into four groups of 1. Unharmed 2. Killed 3. Injured hospitalized 4. Slightly injured. The data was collected in 2019 in France. Thus, for clarity purposes we had to translat the columns into English.
